                    <b> Hi everyone! Iâ€™m Aryan Kumar, a senior in engineering at Lloyd College of engineering .. </b>           
I have always enjoyed math and science from a young age, but I recently realized that engineering was my path. My favorite part about engineering is that it is not just an academic subject but also involves real-world applications. It allows students to learn how things work differently than they would see in class.
I look forward to getting involved with the community at Lloyd College of engineering and learning as much as possible from the professors there!
